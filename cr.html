                    </h3>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Clash Royale was created by Supercell, a studio in Helsinki, Finland. A small team experimented with mixing card games, tower defense, and real-time battles. Using characters from Clash of Clans, they built a faster, competitive game that still felt familiar to Clash fans. After months of testing, they struck the balance between fun, strategy, and mobile play.

                    </h3>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Clash Royale is a real-time strategy card game. Players collect and upgrade cards representing troops, spells, and defenses, then battle in live 1v1 or 2v2 matches. The goal is to destroy enemy towers within 3 minutes. With quick matches, unique units, and regular updates, the game blends strategy and fast reactions, keeping it fresh for millions of players.

                    </h3>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Development started after Clash of Clans‚Äô success. Clash Royale was soft-launched in January 2016 in Canada and Australia, then released worldwide on March 2, 2016.

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        The game was built in Supercell‚Äôs Helsinki headquarters, where developers used the Clash of Clans universe to create something new. By combining existing assets with fresh mechanics, they launched a game that expanded the Clash brand while standing on its own.

                    <h3>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Supercell wanted a faster, live PvP experience compared to Clash of Clans‚Äô offline raids. Clash Royale was designed to be quick, competitive, and skill-based, rewarding timing and smart deck-building. It gave players a new way to enjoy the Clash world while pushing mobile gaming into real-time esports.
