            <h1>Dwayne the Shrek johnson</h1>
            <p>this one started as a playful internet joke combining the names and
                images of two famous figures: Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, the well-known
                wrestler and actor, and Shrek, the iconic animated ogre. People began
                editing pictures of Shrek to resemble The Rock, often adding muscular
                features or expressions that mimic The Rock’s tough-guy persona. The
                name “Dwane the Shrek Johnson” is a humorous mashup playing on this
                blend, mixing the familiar name with the beloved character. The meme
                caught on because it’s funny to imagine Shrek as a strong, charismatic
                action star, much like The Rock, creating a quirky contrast that meme
                fans loved to share.</p>
